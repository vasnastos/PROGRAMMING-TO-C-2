Because the focus in this book is on object-oriented programming, we can leave out some features of C that are seldom used and are not particularly relevant to OOP. For instance, it isn't
necessary to understand the C bit-wise operators (used to operate on individual bits) to learn
object-oriented programming. These and a few other features can be dropped from our discussion, or mentioned only briefly, with no loss in understanding of the major features of C++.

The exercises vary considerably in their degree of difficulty. In each chapter the early exercises
are fairly easy, while later ones are more challenging. Instructors will probably want to assign
only those exercises suited to the level of a particular class.
